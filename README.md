# Kumo's Life

The project "Kumo's Life" draws inspiration from Tamagotchi, the popular handheld electronic games centered around raising a virtual pet. The objective of this project is to create a similar game where users can interact with their virtual pet cloud named Kumo.

In "Kumo's Life", users will be able to engage with their pet cloud using various sensors on their mobile devices. They can play with Kumo, put it to sleep, scold it, and much more, all through the interactive features made possible by the device's sensors.

The game aims to provide an engaging and immersive experience, allowing users to form a bond with their virtual pet cloud. By simulating different activities and interactions, users can take care of Kumo and watch it grow and thrive.
